  Our project is a secure and reliable medical document storage and verification application  using Blockchain technology called HealthMe.
   It will allow the users to have access to all  their medical records, anytime, anywhere. 
   It will include a document verification system  using blockchain, to ensure that the medical documents submitted by the patient are authentic.

<ul>
<li> It  can get difficult to keep track of the ones we need at the moment.</li>
<li>  We can misplace them, </li> 
<li>damage them or not carry the correct documents when visiting the hospital,</li>
<li>  which can be a  hassle.</li>
  </ul><br></br>
   It is also inconvenient for most people to spend hours waiting to pick up test results  from a lab,
    or having to make multiple trips to pick them up and submit them to a medical  professional. 
    From a doctorâ€™s perspective, ensuring that the documents received are authentic  is essential.
